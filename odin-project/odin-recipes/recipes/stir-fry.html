        <li>2/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 head broccoli, broken into florets</li>
        <li>1 onion, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to 
        medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 
        20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium glass 
        or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; 
        add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 
        15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. 
        Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper; cook and stir until 
        just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over medium-high
        heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per 
        side; stir in vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until 
        chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. 
        Serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
